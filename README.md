# INFO-3225-project
top-down tile-based dungeon-crawler game with randomly generated levels.

Implemented in Processing: A java-based API and IDE for streamlined graphics rendering and input processing.

Implemented skills:

- Very modular, extendable and encapsulated design.
- Practiced OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritence, polymorphism/dynamic binding, data-hiding, and abstraction.
- Randomly-generated maps that are built recursively and represented as an n-ary tree.

Design Patterns practiced:

- State: - to seperate the multiple game states (start, running, end) and handle user input.
- Factory-Builder: - Encapsulates game object and game level creation into a simple set of methods.
